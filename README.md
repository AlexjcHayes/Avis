% remember if trying to add things to have a space after the comma %


(DONE)-fix the try and except and find a way to have it train when I want it to
(DONE)-compare old files to make sure they haven't been changed
    -might have to have it save twice, one as and old and one as a new
    -then check to see if the new one matches the old (The updated intents file will always be the new) then it would retrain the model if the file has been changed
(DONE)- implement voice (maybe have it detect when you're either typing or talking)
    -make it so that it detects either voice or type
(DONE)- implement some sort of text to speech function for Theo
- implement system commands
(DONE)- have it make online searches based off of custom phrases
(DONE)- Check to make sure there is an internet connection to connect to the Google API
(DONE)- have it parse out certain phrases in internet search request
(DONE)- have it give the weather(Might have to parse the data from google using re (?P<location>\w+) (or from the video)
(DONE)- have it do simple math
- have object classification (Maybe) (take forever to implement)
- implement an interface (going to have to take out the While loop in the chat method since the kivy eliminates the need for it and make this file one big kivy class)
- add visual effects (DO this later)
(Work in Progress)- have it guess the category of unknown words and phrases (A Strong Maybe) (Need a lot of data to work from) (Possibly need it to be able to append to the intent.json file)
-have it not wait for the speech response to finish playing before being ready to display "You: " for user input (multi threading)
- Have it recognize objects with webcam
